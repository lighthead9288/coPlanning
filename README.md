# Co-Planning

Planning our own time is an important part of our life. Everybody made schedules ever, because everybody had a list of tasks that should be completed at exact time. 
And, quite possibly, there is a task in this list, which should done by several people, and you should take into account a schedule of other person. And what if there are several such people?

Co-planning is an application, which can help to solve this issue. You can create your own task list with the time of their execution, see task lists of other users, match the task list with others on a certain time interval and get a list of time intervals, in which none of the "participants" of the matching has any task.

Besides users can subscribe on other users schedules or on exact tasks in these schedules.

How to use it?
